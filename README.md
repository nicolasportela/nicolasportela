### Hi there! I'm [Nicol√°s](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolasportela) üëã

I am a software developer with the particularity of having dedicated myself previously and for several years to the study and work in the field of Social Sciences. I appreciate the comprehensive training in hard and soft skills that this dual career has allowed me to develop.

I consider myself detail-oriented and eager to incorporate new knowledge, and I enjoy teamwork, collaboration and agile methodologies as a way to manage projects.

On a technical level, my main tastes and skills are oriented towards frontend development with JavaScript frameworks (especially Angular), although Python also excites me as a language.
