### Hi there! I'm [Nicol√°s](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolasportela) üëã

I'm an enthusiast full-stack developer with a past of 13 years studying and working in Social Sciences. After many years collaborating with developers and communities as user, I decided in 2019 to start a progressive transition to turn that hobby into my new career as software developer, attracted by the fun, opportunities and challenges this amazing world of programming offers.

### My passions and favorite tools üòç
I'm a passionate of backend development, and I love Python language, APIs building and handling as well as databases management through MySQL. Right now, I'm venturing into new knowledge about Node, Express, Angular and TypeScript, because of their huge power for web development.
<br>
Besides the technical skills and likes, I enjoy team work, collaboration and agiles methodologies as a way of managing projects.
