### Hi there! I'm [Nicol√°s](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolasportela) üëã

I am a software developer eager to learn, with the particularity of having a past of 13 years studying and working in the field of Social Sciences. It was in 2019 that I started a formative/labor conversion, after several years collaborating with developers and communities at user level. It was thus that I decided to start a progressive transition to turn said hobby into my new profession, attracted by the entertainment, opportunities and challenges that the world of programming offers.
<br>

### My passions and favorite tools üòç
I am particularly enthusiastic about Python as a language, but I have lately worked with and discovered the power of JavaScript and its frameworks for web development.  
Apart from technical tastes and skills, I enjoy teamwork, collaboration and agile methodologies as a way to manage projects.
